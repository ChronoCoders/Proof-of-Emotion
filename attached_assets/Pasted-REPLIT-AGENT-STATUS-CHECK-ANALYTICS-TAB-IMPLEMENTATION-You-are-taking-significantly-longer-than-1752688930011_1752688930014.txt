REPLIT AGENT STATUS CHECK - ANALYTICS TAB IMPLEMENTATION

You are taking significantly longer than usual to implement the Analytics tab for EmotionalChain. This is concerning because:
- Previous tabs (Dashboard, Validators, Consensus, Biometrics, Testing Suite) were completed efficiently
- The Analytics tab is the final component to complete the revolutionary platform
- Extended delays suggest a specific technical issue or blocker

IMMEDIATE DIAGNOSTIC REQUIRED:

1. **CURRENT STATUS CHECK:**
   - What specific step are you currently stuck on?
   - Are you encountering file creation issues again?
   - Is the Analytics tab content more complex than previous tabs?
   - Are you having memory or processing limitations?

2. **TECHNICAL ISSUE IDENTIFICATION:**
   - Are you successfully using the str_replace_based_edit_tool with file_text parameter?
   - Is the Analytics tab TypeScript/React code more complex than previous implementations?
   - Are you encountering specific errors that weren't present in previous tabs?
   - Is there a performance issue with the comprehensive analytics features?

3. **PROGRESS ASSESSMENT:**
   - What percentage of the Analytics tab have you completed?
   - Which specific analytics features are proving most challenging?
   - Are the business intelligence components causing processing delays?
   - Is the predictive analytics implementation more complex than expected?

4. **COMPARISON WITH PREVIOUS TABS:**
   - Why is Analytics taking longer than Biometrics or Testing Suite?
   - Are you reusing successful patterns from previous tab implementations?
   - Is the analytics content fundamentally different in complexity?
   - Are you encountering new technical challenges not seen before?

5. **RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS:**
   - Are you running into memory limitations with complex analytics calculations?
   - Is the comprehensive data visualization causing processing delays?
   - Are the predictive modeling features too resource-intensive?
   - Do you need to simplify the analytics implementation approach?

REQUIRED RESPONSE FORMAT:
Provide a clear status update including:
- "CURRENT STATUS: [exactly what you're working on now]"
- "TECHNICAL ISSUE: [specific problem encountered, if any]"
- "COMPLETION ESTIMATE: [how much longer needed]"
- "ASSISTANCE NEEDED: [what help would accelerate completion]"

PRIORITY CONTEXT:
- This is the final component of a revolutionary blockchain platform
- The Analytics tab completes the world's first emotion-based blockchain ecosystem
- Timely completion is critical for academic submissions and investor presentations
- The delay is unusual compared to previous successful implementations

DO NOT attempt to continue implementation until you provide this diagnostic information.
RESPOND WITH CLEAR STATUS UPDATE FIRST.

If you're encountering specific technical blockers, we need to resolve them immediately rather than continue struggling with the same issue.
