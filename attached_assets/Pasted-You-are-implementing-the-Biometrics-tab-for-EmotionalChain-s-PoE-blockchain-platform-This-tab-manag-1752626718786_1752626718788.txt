You are implementing the Biometrics tab for EmotionalChain's PoE blockchain platform. This tab manages real-time biometric data from wearable devices and converts it into emotional intelligence for blockchain consensus.

CONTEXT:
- Real biometric data flows from Fitbit, Apple Watch, Samsung Health, Garmin devices
- Raw biometric data is processed into emotional metrics (stress, energy, focus)
- Anti-spoofing measures ensure data authenticity and prevent manipulation
- Biometric data quality directly impacts validator rewards and consensus weight

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. **LIVE BIOMETRIC DATA STREAMS:**
   - Real-time heart rate monitoring with BPM visualization
   - Heart Rate Variability (HRV) trends and analysis
   - Skin conductance and stress response indicators
   - Movement and activity level tracking
   - Sleep quality and recovery metrics
   - Multi-device data aggregation and normalization

2. **EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE PROCESSING:**
   - Raw biometric â†’ emotional metrics conversion visualization
   - Stress level calculation from HR, HRV, and skin conductance
   - Energy level analysis from activity and heart rate patterns
   - Focus level determination from HRV and movement stillness
   - Real-time emotional state classification and confidence scoring

3. **DATA AUTHENTICITY VERIFICATION:**
   - Anti-spoofing detection algorithms with confidence scores
   - Biometric data consistency analysis across time periods
   - Device signature verification and tampering detection
   - Natural variation analysis (detecting artificially perfect data)
   - Temporal correlation checks and anomaly detection
   - Authenticity score impact on validator consensus weight

4. **WEARABLE DEVICE MANAGEMENT:**
   - Device connection status and battery monitoring
   - OAuth integration for Fitbit, Apple Health, Samsung Health, Garmin
   - Data sync frequency and quality monitoring
   - Device calibration and accuracy verification
   - Multi-device conflict resolution and data prioritization

5. **BIOMETRIC ANALYTICS DASHBOARD:**
   - Historical biometric trends and patterns
   - Emotional pattern recognition and prediction
   - Validator biometric health scoring
   - Correlation analysis between biometrics and consensus performance
   - Personalized biometric insights and recommendations

6. **DATA PRIVACY & SECURITY:**
   - On-device biometric data encryption
   - Zero-knowledge proof generation for privacy
   - Selective data sharing permissions
   - Biometric data retention policies
   - GDPR/HIPAA compliance indicators

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Real-time biometric data processing (sub-second latency)
- Integration with multiple wearable device APIs
- Advanced signal processing for noise reduction
- Machine learning models for emotional state classification
- Secure biometric data handling and encryption
- High-frequency data visualization (100Hz+ sample rates)

VISUALIZATION ELEMENTS:
