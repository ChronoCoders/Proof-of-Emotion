You are implementing the Testing Suite tab for EmotionalChain's PoE blockchain platform. This tab provides comprehensive testing, validation, and stress testing capabilities for the world's first emotion-based consensus mechanism.

CONTEXT:
- PoE consensus is completely novel and requires extensive testing
- Network must handle various emotional states, attack scenarios, and edge cases
- Testing validates scalability, security, and consensus reliability
- Results provide confidence for investors, validators, and network participants

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. **CONSENSUS STRESS TESTING:**
   - Multi-validator consensus simulation (5, 10, 25, 50, 100+ validators)
   - Rapid consensus testing with high-frequency emotional data updates
   - Network latency simulation and performance under load
   - Consensus timeout testing and recovery mechanisms
   - Validator dropout scenarios and network resilience testing
   - Peak load testing: maximum validators before performance degradation

2. **EMOTIONAL ATTACK SIMULATIONS:**
   - Anti-spoofing attack testing: fake biometric data injection
   - Coordinated emotional manipulation attempts
   - Sybil attack resistance with multiple fake validators
   - Eclipse attack simulation targeting emotional consensus
   - Adversarial emotional state injection testing
   - Network partition recovery under emotional disagreement

3. **BIOMETRIC DATA VALIDATION TESTING:**
   - Authentic vs. synthetic biometric data detection accuracy
   - Edge case biometric values (extreme heart rates, impossible HRV)
   - Device spoofing attempts and detection effectiveness
   - Temporal consistency validation across data streams
   - Multi-device conflict resolution testing
   - Biometric noise and artifact filtering effectiveness

4. **CONSENSUS ALGORITHM VALIDATION:**
   - Mathematical correctness of emotional weight calculations
   - Consensus threshold testing (60%, 67%, 75% agreement requirements)
   - Stake-weighted consensus accuracy under various distributions
   - Emotional similarity algorithm precision testing
   - Byzantine fault tolerance with emotional manipulators
   - Consensus finality and rollback prevention testing

5. **NETWORK PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKING:**
   - Consensus time measurement across network sizes
   - Throughput testing: blocks per minute under load
   - Memory and CPU usage optimization analysis
   - WebSocket performance under high-frequency updates
   - Database query optimization for historical consensus data
   - Mobile device performance testing (validator apps)

6. **AUTOMATED TEST SUITE:**
   - Continuous integration testing for PoE algorithm changes
   - Regression testing for consensus mechanism updates
   - Property-based testing for emotional consensus edge cases
   - Fuzzing tests for biometric data input validation
   - Integration testing with real wearable device APIs
   - End-to-end testing from biometric data to consensus finality

7. **TEST REPORTING & ANALYTICS:**
   - Comprehensive test result dashboards with pass/fail rates
   - Performance benchmarking over time with trend analysis
   - Security vulnerability assessment reports
   - Consensus reliability scoring and confidence metrics
   - Network readiness assessment for mainnet launch
   - Investor-ready testing validation reports

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Automated test execution with scheduled runs
- Real-time test progress monitoring and result visualization
- Integration with existing PoE consensus algorithm
- Load testing infrastructure for high validator counts
- Security testing tools for attack simulation
- Performance profiling and bottleneck identification

VISUALIZATION ELEMENTS:
- Real-time test execution progress bars
- Network performance graphs under various loads
- Attack simulation results with success/failure indicators
- Consensus reliability metrics over time
- Interactive test scenario builders
- Test result export and sharing capabilities

This tab proves EmotionalChain's PoE consensus is not just innovative but also robust, secure, and ready for real-world deployment.
