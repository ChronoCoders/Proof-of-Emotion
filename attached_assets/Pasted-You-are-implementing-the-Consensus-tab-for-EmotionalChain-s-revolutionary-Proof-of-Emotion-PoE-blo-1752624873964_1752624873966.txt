You are implementing the Consensus tab for EmotionalChain's revolutionary Proof of Emotion (PoE) blockchain platform. This tab visualizes the world's first emotional consensus mechanism in real-time.

CONTEXT:
- PoE consensus requires 67% emotional agreement among validators
- Consensus is calculated from weighted biometric data (heart rate, HRV, stress, energy, focus)
- Each block contains emotional metadata alongside traditional blockchain data
- Validators are rewarded based on emotional contribution to network health

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. **REAL-TIME CONSENSUS MONITOR:**
   - Live consensus calculation visualization with progress indicators
   - Emotional agreement percentage with dynamic color coding
   - Participating validators count and stake weight distribution
   - Consensus threshold status (reached/failed) with visual indicators
   - Time to consensus measurement and optimization metrics

2. **EMOTIONAL CONSENSUS BREAKDOWN:**
   - Individual validator emotional states during consensus
   - Weighted emotional averages: network stress, energy, focus levels
   - Emotional variance analysis and agreement patterns
   - Authenticity score impact on consensus weight
   - Outlier detection and consensus influence analysis

3. **BLOCK CREATION TIMELINE:**
   - Chronological block creation with emotional metadata
   - Block emotional fingerprint: stress/energy/focus snapshot
   - Consensus success/failure reasons and validator participation
   - Block reward distribution based on emotional contribution
   - Historical consensus trends and pattern recognition

4. **CONSENSUS ANALYTICS:**
   - Consensus success rate over time with trend analysis
   - Average time to emotional consensus
   - Validator behavior patterns during consensus
   - Network emotional health correlation with consensus speed
   - Predictive consensus modeling based on current emotional states

5. **CONSENSUS SIMULATION:**
   - "What-if" scenarios: how would consensus change with different validator emotions
   - Stress testing consensus with simulated emotional states
   - Consensus attack resistance testing (fake emotion injection)
   - Network resilience analysis under emotional stress conditions

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Real-time WebSocket integration for live consensus updates
- Advanced data visualization (charts, graphs, heatmaps)
- Integration with existing PoE algorithm consensus calculations
- Performance optimization for rapid consensus updates
- Historical data storage and retrieval
- Export functionality for consensus reports

VISUALIZATION ELEMENTS:
- Animated consensus progress bars
- Real-time emotional state heatmaps
- Interactive block timeline with drill-down capabilities
- Validator consensus participation network graphs
- Emotional trend charts with predictive analytics

Make this tab the centerpiece that demonstrates how human emotions actually drive blockchain consensus - this is what makes EmotionalChain revolutionary.
