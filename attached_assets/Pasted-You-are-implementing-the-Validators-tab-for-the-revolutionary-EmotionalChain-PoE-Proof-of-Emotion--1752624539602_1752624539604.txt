You are implementing the Validators tab for the revolutionary EmotionalChain PoE (Proof of Emotion) blockchain platform. This tab manages the network's emotional validators who stake tokens and provide real biometric data for consensus.

CONTEXT:
- Users can register as validators by staking EMOTION tokens and connecting wearable devices
- Each validator provides real-time biometric data (heart rate, HRV, stress levels) for consensus
- The system includes anti-spoofing measures and authenticity scoring
- Validators earn rewards based on emotional stability and network contribution

FEATURES TO IMPLEMENT:

1. **VALIDATOR REGISTRATION SECTION:**
   - Registration form: wallet address, stake amount (min 10,000 EMOTION), device selection
   - Device connection interface: Fitbit, Apple Watch, Samsung Health, Garmin
   - OAuth flows for device authorization
   - Stake verification and escrow functionality
   - Registration status tracking (pending, active, rejected)

2. **ACTIVE VALIDATORS GRID:**
   - Live validator cards showing: address, stake, device type, emotional state
   - Real-time biometric data: current heart rate, stress %, energy %, focus %
   - Authenticity score and anti-spoofing status
   - Online/offline status with last seen timestamp
   - Performance metrics: blocks validated, consensus participation rate
   - Reputation score and slashing history

3. **VALIDATOR PERFORMANCE DASHBOARD:**
   - Individual validator analytics: uptime, rewards earned, penalties
   - Network contribution scoring
   - Emotional stability trends over time
   - Comparative performance rankings
   - Staking rewards calculator

4. **NETWORK HEALTH MONITORING:**
   - Total validators count and distribution
   - Average network authenticity score
   - Validator geographical distribution map
   - Device type diversity metrics
   - Stake concentration analysis

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Match the existing dark theme and neon accent design
- Real-time WebSocket updates for live validator data
- Integration with existing PoE consensus algorithm
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Data persistence for validator history
- Security measures for sensitive biometric data

DELIVERABLES:
- Complete validators.html page with interactive UI
- JavaScript module for validator management
- Real-time data integration with WebSocket
- Form validation and error handling
- Performance optimization for 100+ validators

Make this tab feel like a professional blockchain explorer but focused on emotional intelligence rather than traditional transactions.
